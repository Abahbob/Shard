TCEA Elements 2014

You wake up, the image of Earth's cataclysm still burning in your mind. As you look out your starboard window you see the shattered remains of your home drift by. In the distance, you can see the blue shells of the vessels that appeared seconds before Earth's destruction began. There is no doubt that these alien constructions were the cause of Earth's demise. In memory of your fallen people, you swear vengeance on the mysterious aggresors, you will let none leave alive.
